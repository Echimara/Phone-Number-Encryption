<h2 align="center" width="1200px"> Phone-Number-Encryption </h2> 

This program uses simple regex-matching properties to detect whether an inputted phone number matches a specific format. <br>
If yes, the program outputs a randomized string of letters as a form of encrypting the inputter number.

To run: This file is called "phone_encrypter.sed". <br>
You shall need another file of phone numbers called "phone.txt" (in this repo). <br>
In a terminal, such as Putty, type: sed -r -f phone_encrypter.sed phone.txt 

The output is a list of the encrypted phone numbers.
